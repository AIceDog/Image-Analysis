# K-Means++ Algorithm

## 1. About This Project
The objective of this project is to implement a segmentation program based on K-means. The program assigns to each pixel in the image a unique label corresponding to its class.

## 2. Brief Problem Definition
In this project, an image segmentation program is implemented on the .ppm image and .pgm image. To implement image segmentation, the program allows the user to input some information including the name of the image, the image type, and the number of clusters. The program also allows the selection of the features to use for clustering.

## 3. Summary Of Choices Made For The Solution
To implement the K-means algorithm, we mainly use the following two steps:

### The choice of initial cluster centers:
The choice of initial cluster centers is based on the K-means++ algorithm.
The basic idea of selecting the initial cluster centers is that the distance between the initial cluster centers should be as far as possible.
The algorithm is described as follows:
