# Image Enhancement, Smooth and Edge Detector

## 1. Introduction
In this program, image enhancement techniques, image smooth techniques, and edge detectors are implemented to do the image process for 3 given images. This program aims to practice image processing skills and find the best strategy to improve and detect the edges of the given image MRI.pgm with the implemented image processing functions.

#### 2.1.4 Histogram Equalization
Histogram equalization is a method in image processing of contrast adjustment using the image's histogram.

### 2.2 Image Smooth Techniques

#### 2.2.1 Mean Filter
The mean filter is a simple sliding-window spatial filter that replaces the center value in the window with the average (mean) of all the pixel values in the window. The window, or kernel, is usually square but can be any shape.

#### 2.2.2 Median Filter
The median filter is also a sliding-window spatial filter, but it replaces the center value in the window with the median of all the pixel values. As for the mean filter, the kernel is usually square but can be any shape.

#### 2.2.3 Gaussian Filter
The gaussian filter is the spatial filter used to remove gaussian noise in the image. Specifically, it uses a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution to generate an average mask to remove gaussian noise and smooth the image.
